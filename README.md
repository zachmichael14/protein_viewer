## Introduction

This project was primarily inspired by my background in molecular biology. I was thrilled when I found out about the Biopython library and was eager to explore its uses, so I decided to create a Jupyter Notebook app.

I choose Jupyter Notebooks in part because they provide reasonable widget tooling, so making a GUI is relatively straightforward. The Notebooks are served by Binder, which remedies many of the traditional deployment challenges of Jupyter Notebooks.

While there is a small 10-20 second delay while the server spins up, Binder provides all the interactivity of a traditional Notebook but without much of the fuss.

## Technologies
